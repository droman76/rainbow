This is the new messaging system. Make sure you do not use the back button when going back to the main site. Instead close by pressing the little blue X button on top of the message list. <br><br>You will also notice there are some tabs on top of the main feed page. This is how it works.. lets say if you are in Vancouver, Canada and you post in the local tab. A person in Toronto, Canada will see that post in their country tab, a person in the United States will see the post under the continent tab and a person in Europe will see that same post under the world tab. So if you log initially and see no posts under the local tab, it means in your location (city) nobody has posted.. <br>In any case everything is always visible from everybody.. it just gets sorted different depending where you are. <br><br>Also if the location shown is not your actual location, you can update it by editing your profile and specifying your location.<br><br>Thats it! Much love!! ","p_friendrequest":"would like to be your friend."}
